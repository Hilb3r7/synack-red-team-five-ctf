# Synack Red Team Five CTF

Here are all the downloadable files for the CTF and the challenge descriptions. This is all of the challenges except for three of the web challenges that did not provide source code. Also there are brief writeups for the challenges I was able to solve. If anyone has writeups they want to share I'll be happy to add them or include a link to where they can be read.

**note**: Obviously be careful, for all you know I'm hoping to add you to my zombie bot net, so as always inspect anything you download and don't randomly run files from strangers or untrusted sources on the internet. That said, I'm totally trustworhty, if you don't believe me you can ask my mom.
